        <div class="about">GENERAL INFO:<br/></div>
        <div class="quote">"Mental illness is  nothing to be shamed of ,but stigma and bias shame us all"<br/></div>

        <div class="defi">Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize 
            their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value 
            and is integral to our well-being.<br/>At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may 
            combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances –
            including poverty, violence, disability and inequality – are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.<br/>
        Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment
            gaps are wide all over the world. Mental health care is often poor in quality when delivered. People with mental health conditions often also experience stigma, discrimination and human rights violations.</div>

        <div class="imptotalk">The fear of judgment silences many from discussing mental health openly. This silence perpetuates stigma and prevents individuals from seeking support. Encouraging open conversations can break down barriers, fostering understanding and empathy. Creating safe spaces where people feel heard and accepted is essential for promoting mental health awareness and providing the support individuals need to thrive.</div>

        <div class="global">In 2019, 970 million people globally were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common.Globally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability. 
            People with severe mental health conditions die 10 to 20 years earlier than the general population. And having a mental health condition increases the risk of suicide and experiencing human rights violations.
            Mental health conditions are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will experience major depression in their lives.
            Other conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are less common but still have a large impact on people’s lives.</div>
    <img src="graph.png" alt="burden of diesease from each category of  mental issues,world 2019 ">
        
        
       <div class="content2"> These pointers highlight the importance of self-awareness, social support, professional assistance,
        stigma reduction, and healthy coping strategies in maintaining and improving mental health.</div><BR/>
        <div class="about2">1. Self-care and Well-being:</div> <div class="content2">Taking care of oneself is crucial for mental health. This includes getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation. Practicing mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques can also be beneficial.</div><BR/>

        <div class="about2">2. Social Support:</div> <div class="content2">Building and maintaining strong social connections can significantly impact mental well-being. Having a support network of friends, family, or peers can provide emotional support, practical help, and a sense of belonging, reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation.</div><BR/>

        <div class="about2">3. Seeking Professional Help:</div> <div class="content2"> It's important to recognize when professional help is needed. Mental health professionals, such as therapists, counselors, psychologists, or psychiatrists, are trained to provide support and treatment for various mental health concerns. Seeking help early can lead to better outcomes.</div><BR/>

        <div class="about2">4. Reducing Stigma:</div> <div class="content2"> Addressing stigma surrounding mental health is crucial for fostering understanding and empathy. Educating oneself and others about mental health conditions can help reduce stereotypes and discrimination, creating a more supportive environment for those experiencing mental health challenges.</div><BR/>

        <div class="about2">5. Healthy Coping Mechanisms:</div>  <div class="content2">Developing healthy coping mechanisms is essential for managing stress and difficult emotions. This may include practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, engaging in hobbies or activities that bring pleasure, and seeking out support from others when needed. Avoiding unhealthy coping strategies, such as substance abuse or avoidance, is also important.</div><BR/>
        <div class="content2">• Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders.<br/>

                        • Mental health is an integral part of health; indeed, there is no health without mental health.<br/>
                        
                        • Mental health is determined by a range of socioeconomic, biological and environmental factors.<br/>
                        
                        • Cost-effective public health and intersectoral strategies and interventions exist to promote,<br/>
                         protect and restore mental health.</div><br/><br/>
                         <div class="content2">
                        Mental health is an integral and essential component of health. The WHO constitution states:<br/>
                        "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of<br/>
                        disease or infirmity." An important implication of this definition is that mental health is more<br/>
                        than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.</div><br/><br/>
                        <div class="content2">
                        Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities,<br/>
                        can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution<br/>
                        to his or her community.</div><br/><br/>
                        <div class="content2">
                        Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote,<br/> 
                        interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and<br/> 
                        restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and<br/> 
  societies throughout the world.</div><br/><br/>
